         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> brought up other horſe to relieve them: who fell on gallantly, and did good ſervice: and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Enemy neere Shrewsbury, and took many priſoners of qualitie, the Lord <hi>Newports</hi> ſonne a Parliament man, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> hardly eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>The very next day my Lord Generall ſent Captaine <hi>Rent</hi> to give Orders for all horſe and foot to quarter on and about Sutton on the Hill, in the way to Shrewsbury, early next morning vve marched tovvards Mansford Bridge vvhere the Enemy kept Garriſon: and a drawbridge over the Severne: our men fell on gallantly, and my Lord himſelfe appeared in the Van of the Forlorn Hope for their encouragement, which cauſed them to ſtir bravely, and to ſtrive to adventure beyond expreſſion, to gain the paſſage in a quarter of an houres time the Enemy fled: upon which my Lord ſent Cap. <hi>Keme</hi> to call the Forlorn Hope of Horſe, and after other horſe which hee did, and wee came ſo haſtily on, that one Captaine <hi>Shipply</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:154653:3"/>gallant man, not having patience to ſtay till the draw bridge was let down, ventured over the River after him, rent the Forlorn Hope, In purſuit, and my Lord was in the midſt of them, and only one man next me, and not far from my Lord, fell into a hole of the River, hardly eſcaped drowned.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee got out, and by this time the bridge was downe, our Army crowding over. I mean the horſe out of Captaine <hi>Kemes</hi> Troop came in at a houſe over the bridge where they kept the Court of Guard, and tooke a Lievtenant Colonels Colours which he gave his Captaine to preſent to my Lord, but we followed the purſuit, and between the Bridge and the Heath we tooke moſt of the men, and had wee not hallowed for all our horſe to come up we had entred Shrewshury, with the enemie, many of their horſe and foot quartering our of Towne which wee lighted on ſome of <hi>Marrows</hi> Dragoones: We drew up till our armie came up on a Heath on this ſide Shrevvsbury a mile, the enemy came in parties up Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, the lanes vve beat them from them.

                  <p>We made good the ground within Musket ſhot of their Works till night: then ſeeing our little Armie was not able to ſit downe before it: my Lord drew off and vvee retreated that night to the Heath.</p>
                  <p>A mile off and the whole Army quartered in the fields, the horſe, foot and carriages on the Heath. Next morning wee matched away upon advice of the Councell of Warre to Weme: where we quartered all night, being Friday. Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb facs="tcp:154653:4"/>we marched to Whitchurch: On the Lords Day mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my Lord had Captain <hi>Keme</hi> to preach, which he did and after dinner gave him order to order a Randevouz at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Heath which was done: where my Lord further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his intentions to ſend the Caſhire Gentlemen, and on his march to obſerve the commands of the Committees of both Kingdome to ſecure Lancaſhire and Cheſhire to waite on P. <hi>Rupert,</hi> to call in at <hi>Cholmley</hi> houſe, a ſtrong Garriſon of the Enemies: My Lord with his owne Troop and Colonell <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;</hi> and Ma or <hi>Burtons,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Kemes,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Farmers,</hi> and ſome two Troopes more marched to view the ground, we came to it, and found it full of difficultie, unleſſe we ſpent time on it.
