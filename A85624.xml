         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> brought up other hor≈øe to relieve them: who fell on gallantly, and did good ≈øervice: and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued the Enemy neere Shrewsbury, and took many pri≈øoners of qualitie, the Lord <hi>Newports</hi> ≈øonne a Parliament man, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> hardly e≈øcaped.</p>
                  <p>The very next day my Lord Generall ≈øent Captaine <hi>Rent</hi> to give Orders for all hor≈øe and foot to quarter on and about Sutton on the Hill, in the way to Shrewsbury, early next morning vve marched tovvards Mansford Bridge vvhere the Enemy kept Garri≈øon: and a drawbridge over the Severne: our men fell on gallantly, and my Lord him≈øelfe appeared in the Van of the Forlorn Hope for their encouragement, which cau≈øed them to ≈øtir bravely, and to ≈øtrive to adventure beyond expre≈ø≈øion, to gain the pa≈ø≈øage in a quarter of an houres time the Enemy fled: upon which my Lord ≈øent Cap. <hi>Keme</hi> to call the Forlorn Hope of Hor≈øe, and after other hor≈øe which hee did, and wee came ≈øo ha≈øtily on, that one Captaine <hi>Shipply</hi> a

                  <p>Thus wee got out, and by this time the bridge was downe, our Army crowding over. I mean the hor≈øe out of Captaine <hi>Kemes</hi> Troop came in at a hou≈øe over the bridge where they kept the Court of Guard, and tooke a Lievtenant Colonels Colours which he gave his Captaine to pre≈øent to my Lord, but we followed the pur≈øuit, and between the Bridge and the Heath we tooke mo≈øt of the men, and had wee not hallowed for all our hor≈øe to come up we had entred Shrewshury, with the enemie, many of their hor≈øe and foot quartering our of Towne which wee lighted on ≈øome of <hi>Marrows</hi> Dragoones: We drew up till our armie came up on a Heath on this ≈øide Shrevvsbury a mile, the enemy came in parties up Ambu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, the lanes vve beat them from them.
